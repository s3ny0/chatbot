this project is a chatbot. it is designed to give random responses from predefined responses per user query. this makes it dynamic, and more engaging.

i am in the beginning stages of developing it, and I'm hoping to add more functionality in the weeks to come.

at its beginning stages of development, the main functionality is it's ability to satisfy basic queries such as 
1. telling the date and time
2. performing basic mathematical functions
3. having some form of basic conversation. eg. tell me a joke.


future updates will incorporate more functionality and abilities.
